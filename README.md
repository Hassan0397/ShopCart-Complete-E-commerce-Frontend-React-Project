3. CheckoutContext - Checkout form state
4. OrdersContext - Order history & management
```

### **Data Persistence**
- **localStorage** for cart, user sessions, and order history

- **Loading states** throughout the application


## 🎯 Key User Flows

Home → Browse Products → Product Details → Add to Cart → Checkout → Order Confirmation
```

### **2. User Account Flow** 
```
Register/Login → Account Dashboard → Order History → Order Details
